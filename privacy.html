    <h1>Privacy Policy for Our Fitness and Other Tools</h1>

    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> 04/01/2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using our range of fitness and other tools! This privacy policy explains how we handle information in connection with your use of these tools. We are committed to protecting your privacy and being transparent about our data practices.</p>

    <h2>1. Information You Provide (User Input)</h2>
    <p>When you use our various tools, you may provide different types of information depending on the specific tool. This may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Selections and preferences for generating customized content (e.g., workout parameters, nutritional goals, shopping criteria).</li>
        <li>Data for logging and tracking activities (e.g., workout details, shopping items, measurements).</li>
        <li>Numerical input for calculations (e.g., calories, percentages, quantities, prices).</li>
        <li>Textual content that you might paste into certain tools for processing (e.g., workout routines).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1.3. Contact Form Information</h3>
    <p>Our Tools and website are not specifically directed at children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under this age. If you are a parent or guardian and believe that your child has provided us with Personal Information, please contact me immediately at <a href="/contact">my contact page</a>. If we become aware that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13 without verifiable parental consent, we will take steps to delete such information from our records.</p>

    <h3>1.6. Contact Form Information</h3>
    <p>If you choose to contact us through our contact form, we collect the information you provide, which may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your first name</li>
        <li>Your last name (optional)</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>The content of your message or question</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This information is collected via a Tally.so form, and the submissions are stored in a Google Sheet and also sent to our Gmail account. Tally.so's privacy policy governs the collection and handling of data on their platform before it reaches us. You can review their privacy policy at [Link to Tally.so's Privacy Policy]. Google's privacy policy applies to the storage of this data in Google Sheets and their servers. You can review Google's privacy policy at [Link to Google's Privacy Policy].</p>
      
    <h2>2. How We Use This Information</h2>
    <p>The information you provide is used solely for the purpose of delivering the functionality of the specific tool you are using. This includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Generating customized content based on your selections.</li>
        <li>Facilitating the logging and tracking of your activities.</li>
        <li>Performing calculations based on your input and displaying the results.</li>
        <li>Processing and manipulating text you provide within certain tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2.6. Contact Form Communication</h3>
    <p>We use the information you provide through the contact form to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Respond to your inquiries, questions, or requests.</li>
        <li>Provide you with support or information you have requested.</li>
        <li>Keep a record of communications for customer service purposes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Your email address may be used to follow up on your inquiry. We will not use your contact information for marketing purposes unless you have explicitly consented to it.</p>

    <h2>3. Generated and Processed Data</h2>
    <p>The data generated or processed by our tools based on your input is typically displayed directly within your web browser. This data is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us in any way beyond your current session, unless a tool explicitly offers features like saving, copying, or downloading.</p>

    <h2>4. Pasted Data (in Certain Tools)</h2>
    <p>Some of our tools may allow you to paste text for processing or analysis. In such cases:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Data Sanitization:</strong> To enhance security, these tools may utilize client-side libraries (like <code>DOMPurify</code>) to sanitize any pasted text, removing potentially harmful code before processing.</li>
        <li>The text you paste is only used for the intended functionality of that specific tool and is not transmitted to our servers or stored by us.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>To improve your user experience, some of our tools may utilize your browser's local storage. This local storage may be used to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Remember your selected preferences and settings for a tool so they are pre-filled on your next visit.</li>
        <li>Temporarily store data relevant to your current session for ease of use.</li>
        <li>Persist data that you explicitly choose to save within certain logging tools.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The data stored in local storage remains on your computer and is not accessed by us.</p>

    <h2>6. No Transmission of Personal Data</h2>
    <p>We want to emphasize that the information you input into our tools, the data generated or processed by them, and any text you paste <strong>are generally not transmitted to our servers or shared with any third parties</strong>, unless explicitly stated within the description of a specific tool (which currently is not the case for our described tools). The majority of the processing occurs locally within your web browser.</p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention in Local Storage</h2>
    <p>The data stored in your browser's local storage by our tools persists until:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You manually clear your browser's local storage.</li>
        <li>You clear your browser's website data for the domain hosting our tools through your browser settings.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. User Control Over Local Storage</h2>
    <p>You have control over the data stored in your browser's local storage. You can typically view, manage, and clear local storage through your browser's settings or developer tools. Please refer to your browser's documentation for instructions on how to manage local storage.</p>

    <h2>9. Third-Party Libraries</h2>
    <p>Our tools utilize the following client-side JavaScript libraries to enhance their functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Libraries for PDF generation (e.g., <code>jspdf</code>, <code>jspdf-autotable</code>): These are used to generate PDF documents locally within your browser when you use a "download as PDF" feature. They do not transmit your data to their servers.</li>
        <li>Libraries for input sanitization (e.g., <code>DOMPurify</code>): These are used to sanitize user-provided text within certain tools to prevent potential security risks. They operate locally in your browser and do not transmit your data.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>10. Automatically Collected Information</h2>
    <p>We may collect anonymous usage data to understand how our tools are used and to improve them. This data is aggregated and does not typically identify individual users. We may also collect standard technical information such as browser type and operating system for ensuring compatibility.</p>

    <h2>11. Cookies</h2>
    <p>We may use cookies for basic website functionality, such as remembering if you've acknowledged a cookie banner. We do not use cookies for tracking across other websites or for advertising.</p>

    <h2>12. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page, and the "Last Updated" date will be revised. We encourage you to review this policy periodically for any updates.</p>

    <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, please feel free to contact me at: <a href="/contact">My Contact Page</a></p>
